## *rfdrake's original README:*


An XBMC plugin to view the Day[9].tv Daily Archives.


This is based very heavily off of the day9 plugin by
petersson.krill@gmail.com (http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-plugin-day9/)

The plugin has been updated to use the new day9.tv website as it's archive
source, and to use the youtube plugin as the video player.
